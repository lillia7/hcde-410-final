**Proposed Project**

This project aims to utilize data from the WHO database to examine the impact of institutional discrimination based on race, gender, and international politics on countries' strategies and approaches to pandemics and disease outbreaks, with the goal of identifying disparities, uncovering relationships, and informing policy interventions to promote equitable and inclusive healthcare systems globally.
